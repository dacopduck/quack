### Fork the summer-of-git repository

Extra help docs: [Forking repositories](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/ "Forking repositories").

A Fork is a copy of another person's repository onto your GitHub account.
By copying a repository, you may then edit your copy as you see fit (make sure to respect the LICENSE), either for yourself or as a playground before submitting a pull request (patch or fix).

We will be forking the [summer-of-git](https://github.com/nandahibatullah/summer-of-git "summer-of-git") repository to edit it for yourself.

1. Visit [summer-of-git](https://github.com/nandahibatullah/summer-of-git "summer-of-git").
2. Click "Fork" in the top right hand corner. You should be redirected to a copy of the repository
   on your account.

### Clone your summer-of-git repository

Extra help docs: [Cloning your fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone "Cloning your fork").

Cloning a repository will copy it to your computer, so that you may edit it locally.
This can be done a few ways. We're going to do it through the GitHub Desktop client.
(N.B., these instructions are for using the client on a Mac, but it should be very similar for Windows or Linux.)

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.
    1. Click "GitHub Desktop" in the menu bar.
    2. Click "Preferences".
    3. Go to the "Accounts" tab.
    4. Click "Sign In" next to "GitHub.com".
3. Clone your repository.
    1. Click "File" in the menu bar.
    2. Click "Clone Repository...".
    3. Go to the "Github.com" tab.
    4. Find and click "your-username/summer-of-git".
    5. Select a destination path.
    6. Click "Clone".

### Add your name and photo

Update the website! You can do this using your favourite editor.

There are a couple of TODO's in the index.html file:
* Your name.
* Your picture.
* Your blurb.
* Your links.

Edit some or all, and anything else that you want to change.

### Commit and push your changes

We're going to create a commit with the new versions of the files.
We can view what we have changed in GitHub Desktop before making the commit.
We can also choose to only commit some of the changes.

1. Open GitHub Desktop.
2. Ensure "summer-of-git" is selected as the "Current Repository" in the top left corner.
3. Get the commit ready.
    1. Tick any changes you wish to commit in the left hand panel (they will be ticked by default,
       so you shouldn't have to do anything here).
    2. Write a summary and description for the commit.
4. Click commit to master!
5. Click "Push origin" (to the right of "Current Repository" and "Current Branch".

If you click on the "History" tab (just below "Current Repository"), you should see your new commit
at the top.

### View the result

We're going to use GitHub pages to view the result.
GitHub pages is essentially a web server that grabs the website from your repository.
You need to enable it (it's disabled by default), and then you can view the website at https://your-username.github.io/summer-of-git.

1. Open GitHub.
2. Enable GitHub Pages.
    1. Click on "summer-of-git" from "Your repositories" (the box on the right).
    2. Click "Settings" (make sure to click on the repository settings, and not your account settings).
    3. Scroll down to "GitHub Pages".
    4. Select "master" as the "Source".
    5. Click "Save".
3. Visit https://your-username.github.io/summer-of-git (make sure to replace your-username with your
   actual username).
